# Decision-Aware Logistic Regression

## Overview
This project reframes logistic regression from a prediction task to a decision support problem.
The goal is to minimize decision harm by explicitly accounting for asymmetric error costs.

## Decision Context
The model supports clinical decision-making by flagging patients for further diagnostic evaluation.
False negatives are substantially more costly than false positives.

## Key Concepts
- Decision-aware modeling
- Cost-sensitive evaluation
- Threshold optimization
- Why accuracy is insufficient

## Output
- Jupyter notebook demonstrating decision-aware logistic regression
