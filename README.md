## Week 1 :  Decision-Aware Logistic Regression

### Overview
This project reframes logistic regression from a prediction task to a decision support problem.
The goal is to minimize decision harm by explicitly accounting for asymmetric error costs.

### Decision Context
The model supports clinical decision-making by flagging patients for further diagnostic evaluation.
False negatives are substantially more costly than false positives.

### Key Concepts
- Decision-aware modeling
- Cost-sensitive evaluation
- Threshold optimization
- Why accuracy is insufficient

### Output
- Jupyter notebook demonstrating decision-aware logistic regression

## Week 2 — Evaluation Under Uncertainty

- This phase extends the baseline model with scenario-based threshold simulation and expected cost analysis.

Key contributions:
- Scenario-driven threshold tuning
- Expected cost vs threshold visualization
- Precision–recall trade-off analysis with operating points
- Decision trade-off report
